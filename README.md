# AHKScripts
My Auto HotKey scripts to use with my [moonlander layout](https://configure.zsa.io/moonlander/layouts/j6ov4/).

The HyperScroll script is inspired by Mikhail22's [Drag to Scroll](https://github.com/Mikhail22/drag-scroll--autohotkey)

Tested running on Windows 10 using [Auto HotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-install.exe) Ver. 1.1.34.04

To run at start-up, place script file or shortcut to script file in your windows start up folder (%appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup or Win-r then enter "shell:startup")

Make sure to edit variables in scripts to match your file paths to the relevant file/repo.
